The program to create an input file is called make_input.py. This generates a file called input.txt. Pass in a single command line argument when running this program.
The command line argument is for the amount of items to be created in the input file. 

How to run make_input.py:
  python3 make_input.py <item_count>
  
  The file is formatted like this:
   Id Weight Cost Type
   
   An example:
   0 2 30 f
   1 1 40 f
   2 3 30 w

The program to find the max value is called knapsack.py. Pass in a single command line argument when running this program.
The command line argument is for the max weight allowed. This program will read in the input file that make_input.txt generates.

How to run knapsack.py:
  python3 knapsack.py <max_weight>
  This program requires an input file to be created first.
